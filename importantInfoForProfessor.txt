Hi professor, I just wanted to let you know that I reformatted the animalNames.txt a little bit in 
order for my program to run correctly, the only thing I did was delete the empty lines that were in between
every line, that is because my program scans the name is line by line, so if it scans an empty line then 
some values for the animals will just be an empty string instead of the actual value :)
